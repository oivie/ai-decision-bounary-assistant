# 🎯 AI Decision Boundary Assistant - 2 Minute Demo Script

## **Opening Hook (15 seconds)**

*"Imagine your team just spent 3 hours in a meeting discussing a critical product launch. Now someone needs to extract all the decisions, owners, deadlines, and risks from those messy notes. Traditionally, this takes hours of manual work and often misses critical details.*

*Today I'll show you an AI system that does this in seconds, while keeping humans firmly in control of the actual decisions."*

---

## **Problem Setup (20 seconds)**

*"Here's a realistic scenario - a fintech team discussing a new crypto trading feature launch. Look at this messy email thread..."*

**[DEMO ACTION]**: Open http://localhost:8501, select **"Risk/Compliance Decision"** from sidebar

*"Multiple participants, unclear decisions, regulatory concerns, scattered timelines. This is what real business communication looks like. Normally someone would spend an hour manually extracting the key decisions."*

---

## **AI Analysis Demo (25 seconds)**

*"Watch what happens when we apply AI decision intelligence..."*

**[DEMO ACTION]**: Click **"🔍 Analyze Conversation"**

*"In 3 seconds, the AI has extracted structured decisions with confidence scores, identified the key risks, surfaced assumptions, and even flagged what questions remain unanswered.*

*Notice the color-coded confidence levels - green for high confidence, red for uncertain extractions. The AI shows its work with exact quotes as evidence."*

---

## **Human Boundary Demonstration (30 seconds)**

**[DEMO ACTION]**: Navigate through tabs, focus on **"Human Boundary"** tab

*"Here's what makes this different from typical AI systems - it explicitly identifies what humans must decide. Look at this critical decision: 'Final approval for crypto trading feature launch'.*

*The AI won't make regulatory, financial, or strategic decisions. It structures the information but humans retain accountability. Notice the approval checkboxes - every decision requires human sign-off."*

**[DEMO ACTION]**: Show approval workflow in Decisions tab

*"The system creates an audit trail but never bypasses human judgment on critical matters."*

---

## **Real-World Impact (25 seconds)**

**[DEMO ACTION]**: Try High-Stakes Mode toggle, show Decision Log export

*"For high-stakes situations, the AI becomes even more conservative. And when you're done, it generates audit-ready documentation for compliance teams.*

*This isn't about replacing human decision-making - it's about expanding what humans can handle. Teams can now process 10x more conversations while maintaining better oversight and documentation."*

---

## **Closing Value Proposition (15 seconds)**

*"This is AI that meaningfully expands human capability while respecting human judgment. Perfect for regulated industries where decisions need transparency and accountability.*

*The result? Better decisions, faster processing, complete audit trails, and humans stay in control where it matters most."*

**[DEMO ACTION]**: Quick show of CLI: `python cli.py --text "Quick example"`

*"Available as both web interface and command-line tool for integration into existing workflows."*
